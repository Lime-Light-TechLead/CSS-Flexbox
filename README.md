# CSS-Flexbox

**Bonus Task !**

“Flexible layout” (Flexbox) is a CSS feature which provides an efficient way to layout, align and order items in a given container. Partnered with Grid and other specifications it makes up a more complete layout module, in answer to floats and tables and other hacks web designers have been using over the years. 

With Flexbox, items can be laid out in any direction and can adjust their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent

To visualize the code you may use the online IDE: CodePen (https://codepen.io).
